#  Exercises: Day 9
#1 Get user input using input(“Enter your age: ”). If user is 18 or older, give feedback: You are old enough to drive. If below 18 give feedback to wait for the missing amount of years. Output:

age= int(input('Enter your age:'))

if age >= 18:
    print('You are old enough to Drive')
else:
    print(f'Kindly wait for {18 - age} more years to be Eligible')

#2 Compare the values of my_age and your_age using if … else. Who is older (me or you)? Use input(“Enter your age: ”) to get the age as input. You can use a nested condition to print 'year' for 1 year difference in age, 'years' for bigger differences, and a custom text if my_age = your_age. Output:

my_age= 50
your_age= int(input('Enter your age:'))

if my_age > your_age:
    print(f'I am {my_age - your_age} years older thaan you')
elif my_age==your_age:
        print('We are age maates')
else:
    print(f'You are {your_age - my_age} years older than me')


#3 Get two numbers from the user using input prompt. If a is greater than b return a is greater than b, if a is less b return a is smaller than b, else a is equal to b. Output:

a= int(input('Enter first number:'))
b= int(input('Enter second number:'))

if a > b:
    print('A is greater than B')
elif a < b:
     print('A is lesser than B')
else:
    print ('A and B are equal')

#4 Write a code which gives grade to students according to theirs scores: 90-100, A 80-89, B 70-79, C 60-69, D 0-59, F

score= int(input('Enter your score to get graded:'))

if score >= 90:
    if score < 100:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('Invalid Score')
elif score >=80:
    if score < 89:
        print('B')
elif score >= 70:
    if score < 79:
        print('C')
elif score >= 60:
    if score < 69:
        print('D')
else:
    print('F')

#5 Get the month from user input then check if the season is Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer. If the user input is: September, October or November, the season is Autumn. December, January or February, the season is Winter. March, April or May, the season is Spring June, July or August, the season is Summer

month= input('Enter Month:')

Autumn= ('September','October','November')
Winter= ('December','January','February')
Spring= ('March','April', 'May')
Summer= ('June', 'July','August')

if month in Autumn:
    print('Autumn')
elif month in Winter:
    print("winter")
elif month in Spring:
    print('Spring')
elif month in  Summer:
    print('Summer')
else :
    print('Error! Enter month again with First letter in Uppercase')
