# sets
it_companies = {'Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'}
A = {19, 22, 24, 20, 25, 26}
B = {19, 22, 20, 25, 26, 24, 28, 27}
age = [22, 19, 24, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]

#1 Find the length of the set it_companies
print(len(it_companies))

#2. Add 'Twitter' to it_companies

it_companies.add('Twitter')

#3 Insert multiple IT companies at once to the set it_companies

it_companies.update(['Tecno','Huawei','Oraimo'])

#4 Remove one of the companies from the set it_companies

it_companies.pop()

#5 What is the difference between remove and discard

#remove returns an error whem the item to be deleted is not found while discard doesnt return an error

#4 Are A and B disjoint sets

print(A.isdisjoint(B))

#5 Join A with B and B with A

print(A.update(B))
print(B.update(A))

#6 What is the symmetric difference between A and B

print(A.symmetric_difference(B))

#7 Delete the sets completely

del A,B 

# Exercises: Level 3
# Convert the ages to a set and compare the length of the list and the set, which one is bigger?

elif len_list < len_set:
    print(f' Set is bigger')
else:
    print(f'They are Equal')
